      <h3>Q.When it all started.</h3>
      <p>A. It was started all from 2019 when the movie Mission Mangal was released. I was very ecxited to make new things that are literally working and so I made MERO. But I was not satisfied with the name. And so now I kept it RERO. And a fact, I kept this name as RERO because the full form of MERO is Mumbai Earth Research Organization. I am not a government Official because it had "Mumbai" so it sounded like a government agency. And so I thought that it should be RERO not MERO.RERO is Rudransh Earth Research Organization...<br> In 2020 on 26jan I got a kit for kids. That was it, I was pretty sure that I will use it later for project so I will get First position in it. But Lockdown came And a year passed but it was not used. Actually I am a sceince kid and computer one too! So I used it and I made Fan and Light. Then I heard about coding and Learned and made game and app. And then I named it to UT.</p>
